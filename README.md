### Introduction

As stated in the course project description, "one of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article."](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/) This project analyzes data collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The resulting output is a tidy data set that can be used in subsequent analysis.

A full description of the original data set, as well as the data itself, are available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Initial Dataset: [UCI HAR Data](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), provided as zipped file.
