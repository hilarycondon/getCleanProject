### Introduction

As stated in the course project description, "one of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article."](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/) This project analyzes data collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones and demonstrates the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The resulting output is a tidy data set that can be used in subsequent analysis.

A full description of the original data set, as well as the data itself, are available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The initial Dataset, [UCI HAR Data](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), is provided as zipped file.

### Intstructions to Reproduce This Project

### run_analysis.R Script Overview

This script does the following: 
***
**1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.**
  + Note: Explain how
**2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.**
  + Note: Explain how these have been determined. 
**3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.**
  + Note: Explain Why Descriptive. 
**4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.**
  + Note: Explain Why Descriptive. 
**5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.**
  + Explain Why Tidy
